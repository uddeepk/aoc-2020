Day-10 AoC 2020

1035, Dec10. The second part of the problem was difficult. I had a recursive solution really quick, however, I had to use memoization. Though I wasn't the best at working through it. Also, next time, if the solution is not efficient, try to keep working on an efficient solution.

Notes:
1. Learn better application of memoization, and dynamic programming.
2. Learn data structures, and their implementation. Especially trees and graphs.
3. Revisit after learning the C++ library better, or another programming language and clean up the code.
