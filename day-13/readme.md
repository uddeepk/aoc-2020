Day-13 AoC 2020

Interesting day. Had to learn how to apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem. I struggled to wrap my head around the extended Euclidean Algorithm to get the
multiplicative modulo inverse. I have included a bruteforce solution in there too so that I do not do it again.

Notes: 
Learn more intersection of disciplines, and apply them.
