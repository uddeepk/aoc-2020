A look into the Don't Know(Van Eck) Sequence.

Interesting to say the least.

I am keeping the inefficient algorithms, and the program execution as notes of what not to do.

Also, another note at how simplicity and recording is the most efficient. and Maps and other key loopkups and tables increase the memory usage.
