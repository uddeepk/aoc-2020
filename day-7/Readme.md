#Day-7 AOC 2020 

This turned out to be more guess work than thinking. It took me 18 hours. But I did it .... 

Anyways, I have to revisit it once I understand DFS, and trees. I need to learn the data structures, and learn to use map, create graphs ,and use vertices.

My template is messed up.
 Next time I will use a better data structure.
