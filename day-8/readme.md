#Day-8 AOC 2020

I had an easier time than Day 7.

I used a struct to accomplish this. 

The struct held the command, offset, and bool for having been executed or not.

The second part I used a record of the distance of jmp and nop executed from the .begin(). Thus, going through each iterator and only changing one value made me 
print the star2. As I am writing this I have thought if vectors of objects need to deleted if copy of a new vector is assigned to it ?

On the Discord, other people were talking about Discrete Math, and Graph Theory.

Therefore, I would like to visit this program preferably after Spring 2021 semester in Discrete Math, and also CS 202 where I hope to learn the implementation of 
better algorithms, and data structures.
