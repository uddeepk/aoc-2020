This was a bruteforce attempt to check for the answers.

After reading the Discord forums, I have realized that I need to implement the STL for C++ more. 

For example, my Professor used an implementation of sets. from the C++ STL. Then he took a union, and an intersection for the different parts.

I will have to come back and refractor code, ro atleast learn how to implement the other STL libraries.
