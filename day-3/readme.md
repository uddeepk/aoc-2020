So I just basically built three functions. main and two functions to call with parameters to find the results.

I had to use long because int value was not big enough for the second part of the challenge.

I normally use console to input the file using <. However, I saved the fstream version so that I can remember what I did.

I saved the input in a string vector to use on subsequent runs. However, maybe I could have modified it by using multiple counters as it is going down ...
